repackage 'dd' to test fake disk.

compile:
        ./bootstrap
        ./configure
        make

usage:
        sudo ./src/dd -d /dev/fakedisk-want-to-test -s the-Nth-sector-under-test

NOTES:
        the called 'fake disk' is that the real capacity of the disk
        is smaller than the labled capacity. Nowadays, the fakedisk always
        exist in the form of U-Disk/TF Card/SD Card/SSD.

        there is two method to make a fakedisk:
        1) just change alike 'S.M.A.R.T info' of the disk which is reported to
           the host by the disk firmware.
        2) except method 1 , also change the firmware of the disk to support
           the out of capacity read/write from the host.

        In case 1, to test the fake disk , just write-read test of the last sector
        is OK. In case 2, you must write-read test sequitially form the 0th sector
        to the last sector. fot the right disk, th test method of case 2 will reduce
        the disk life!

        below is the single sector test method, the test the whole disk, your just
        need write a loop to call the function dd_main().

        step 1 get disk info  /* find the total sector count exhibited by the disk */
        step 2 generate fix pattern test file
        step 3 read and save original data
        step 4 write fix pattern to disk
        step 5 read again and check
        step 6 restore original data to disk
